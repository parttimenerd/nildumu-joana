Nildumu
=======

An implementation of the quantitative information flow analysis described 
in [my master's thesis](https://pp.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/publication.php?id=bechberger18masterarbeit).

The base implementation is https://github.com/parttimenerd/nildumu.
This implementation is a reimplementation on top of [JOANA](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/projects/joana/).

This repository is obsolete, as nildumu has been merged into JOANA.
